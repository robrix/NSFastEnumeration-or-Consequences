# NSFastEnumeration or Consequences

This is a talk I wrote for [TACOW](http://tacow.org)’s Nov 12th, 2013 meeting. It was supposed to be many things at one time or another, as is the way of these things (at least when I’m involved); as it stands now, it’s about NSFastEnumeration and lazy evaluation.

I primarily strive to answer questions about NSFastEnumeration—wotsit? why bother? how bother? and so forth—and then to discuss what enumeration as an evaluation strategy can do for—or, perhaps, to—you.

Much of the technical material was learned while pursuing some bad ideas with [RXCollections](https://github.com/robrix/RXCollections). Much of the rest of the bad ideas also came from there; I’ve been fond of lazy evaluation for years, but RXCollections gave me an opportunity to be impressed and humbled by the techniques and strategies that it allows, in the way that only hands-on experience can really humble you.
